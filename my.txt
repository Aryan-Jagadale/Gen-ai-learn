Here I am going to write my best references:

1. Fusion: Combining multiple sources of information to improve the accuracy and robustness of the results.
2. Reranking: Reordering the results of a retrieval system based on additional criteria or feedback.
3. Retrieval with Feedback: Using user feedback to refine and improve the retrieval process.
4. Adaptive Retrieval: Adjusting the retrieval process based on the context or changing requirements to provide more relevant results.
5. Knowledge Graph: Utilizing structured representations of knowledge to enhance the retrieval and understanding of information.
6. RAPTOR: A retrieval-augmented generation model that leverages pre-trained language models and retrieval mechanisms to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
7. Self-RAG: A self-supervised retrieval-augmented generation model that improves its retrieval and generation capabilities through self-training and iterative refinement.
8. Corrective RAG: A retrieval-augmented generation model that incorporates corrective feedback to refine and enhance the quality of generated responses.



Note:
Evaluation RAGs remain ( learn)
