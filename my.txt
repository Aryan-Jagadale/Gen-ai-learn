Here I am going to write my best references:

1. Fusion: Combining multiple sources of information to improve the accuracy and robustness of the results.
2. Reranking: Reordering the results of a retrieval system based on additional criteria or feedback.
3. Retrieval with Feedback: Using user feedback to refine and improve the retrieval process.
4. Adaptive Retrieval: Adjusting the retrieval process based on the context or changing requirements to provide more relevant results.
5. Knowledge Graph: Utilizing structured representations of knowledge to enhance the retrieval and understanding of information.

Evaluation RAGs remain ( learn)
